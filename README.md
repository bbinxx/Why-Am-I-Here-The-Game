# WHY AM I HERE üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CodeBlooded


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Bibin - MBCCET
- Member 2: FEBIN - MBCCET

### Project Description
In this oddly enchanting 3D exploration game, you'll wander aimlessly through meadows filled with unnecessarily energetic butterflies while reading randomly changing billboard messages that may or may not make sense. Collect glowing orbs because they're there, and find treasure chests that somehow restore your health (don't ask why)

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
You're looking at a perfectly normal 3D exploration game that has mysteriously gained sentience and decided it needs an existential crisis. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a game that embraces its existential crisis by:

Adding unnecessarily cheerful butterflies that judge your life choices
Displaying random philosophical messages on floating billboards
Scattering glowing orbs that serve no real purpose
Implementing a fog system to hide the void (and rendering limitations)
Creating treasure chests that heal you (because video game logic)
